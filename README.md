Agriculture plays a major role in a country's economy. Plant disease is one of the essential causes that reduce the quantity and degrades the quality of agricultural commodities. Images form important data and information in biological sciences. Digital image processing and image analysis techniques can be used to enhance the images and help in the classification process. The scope of the project is limited to the identification of the disease. Many times a viral or a fungal attack on plants results in degradation of chlorophyll pigments in leaves. Such infected leaves have patches of green and yellow colour.

This project develops a software for the automatic identification and classification of plant leaf diseases. Here the end-user is the farmer. This project classifies the plant leaves into infected and non-infected classes. The developing software provides a fast and accurate method in which the leaf diseases are detected and classified using k-means based segmentation and neural networks based classification. Most common diseases seen in the leaves like soybean, lemon and mango are discussed here for this approach.

The project involves steps like image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. During clustering, the value of k (k-means clustering ) is chosen to be 3 for better prediction of results. After the image feature extraction, neural networks (feed-forward neural network) is used to map a diseased leaf to a particular disease. The project developed under the assumption that all green leaves are considered to be healthy.

The system is trained in MATLAB to identify 4 diseases which are the common bacterial, fungal and viral diseases that could affect a plant and they are Leaf spot, Bacterial blight, Ashen mold, Leaf scorch, citrus cancer. For example, Common bacterial blight symptoms include brown, necrotic lesions surrounded by a bright yellow halo at the leaf margin or interior of the leaf on bean plants. The data of a normal leaf is also fed so that the systemâ€™s classification is not misleading.
