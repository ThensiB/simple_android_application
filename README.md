# simple_android_application

This project is the development of an Android application built using Android Studio and 3rd party APIs that provide GPS capabilities. The app makes use of the functionality provided by Firebase to provide accessibility of data across multiple users in real time.

The user has to first log into the app after installation. The next step is to set the location using GPS or the cellular network. He may choose to add more than one location within the geofence radius. Since the Android app has real-time database connectivity, once the user updates the status, the result is stored in the Firebase database. This is accessed by the app and shows the availability of the user in the app. This status is then displayed in the app which other users can get access to.
